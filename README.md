Project Name: Hotel Reservation System
Tech Stack: Core Java, OOP, Collections Framework, Console I/O

Overview:
This is a menu-driven Java console application that allows users to make, view, and cancel hotel room bookings. The program demonstrates practical application of OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction by modeling real-world entities like hotels, rooms, and reservations.

Key Features:

Add and manage hotel room details

Book and cancel room reservations

Display current booking status and room availability

Implemented using Java classes, methods, and collections

Error handling and input validation for smooth user interaction

Concepts Applied:

Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Polymorphism)

Collections Framework

Console-based input/output handling

Modular, maintainable code structure

Learning Outcome:
Built a hands-on understanding of Java fundamentals, modular design, and problem-solving through real-world application development.
